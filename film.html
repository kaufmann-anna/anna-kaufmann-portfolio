     <p>
        this short film is about how we feel towards language. 
        it is about the anachronism of writing a letter, 
        of expressing words and feelings in a non-digital way.
        this project was a team work between sophie humbert, 
        michelle michewicz and me for audiovisual basics class. </p></div>

        <div class="text"> <div class="ü"><p>inner child</p></div> <p>this short video is presenting sara kaufmann's fashion design project for the pforzheim university of applied sciences. 
            the assignment was to create a fashion design outfit on the topic "protection". 
            "protecting the inner child" was the specific topic she chose. she asked me to come up with an idea for presenting her piece. 
            we wanted to build tension by defining two storylines and using a parallel cut. i took part in creating the concept, story and doing the editing of this short clip.</p></div>
