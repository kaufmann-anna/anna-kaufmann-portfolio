                especially in the dark.</p></div>

                we wanted to create also a possibility for people to get in contact with other people who are searching for a company on their way as well. in order to be able to get in contact, both parties have to accept the match. on the profile of someone, it is possible to see certain details about them: how many successful ways together with another person the person had, and other things the person wants to share.
                to avoid that some people are misuse this for abusing someone, everyone who wants to be part of this community must be verified beforehand via passport.</p></div>
