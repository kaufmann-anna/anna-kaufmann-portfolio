   <div class="frage"><p>who am i?</p></div> 
   <div class="antwort"><p>let's see: i am a daughter, a sister, a friend, a student, a good listener and a designer-to-be.  </p></div> 
  <div class="frage"> <p>what did i do after my a-levels?</p></div> 
   <div class="antwort"><p>i went to israel to volunteer at a non-profit-organisation which helped children with heart diseases from iraq, 
    syria and gaza to get health care and a place to live. It changed my view about things: 
    how fast life can be over, what a privilege it is to live. I learned a lot about goodbyes. </p></div>
<div class="frage"><p>if i had to write a book about what would it be?</p></div> 
   <div class="antwort"><p> if i had to write a guide book, i would write something about
     "getting out of your comfortzone" or "what we can learn from plants".
</p></div> 
  <div class="frage"> <p>what do you love?</p></div> 
   <div class="antwort"><p>i love my family and my friends. i enjoy good company and playing music.
    oh and i love to read novels, to write songs and to photograph in my free time. sometimes i like to do some running activities
    or just watch some great movies. </p></div> 
 <div class="frage"><p>what makes you really angry?</p></div>  
   <div class="antwort"><p>classic answer: injustice. injustice someone is experiencing because of her/his race, gender, sexuality or appearance. 
    beside that, wasting food makes me sad. and when someone has a huge ego and is showing it off, i do not like that too.</p></div> 
  <div class="frage"> <p>what should you know about me?</p></div> 
   <div class="antwort"><p> sometimes i like listening more than talking.</p></div> 
    <div class="frage"><p>which advice would i give a previous version of myself?</p></div>
    <div class="antwort"> <p>a lot of things in life are a process, do not rush the waiting, good things are coming.  </p></div>
